# Progress and Questions

using tdd to think and develop components
shadcn is helpful when you do not have to implement exotic interfaces

the idea is creating "template" for crud operations where we just pass the entity and it implements the interfaces, we find a way of customizing things

features componentes should not import shadcn components directly, abstract it in the future
